# Intro

piss is a lightweight pseudo-3D game engine written in C. It is
mostly focused around raycasting, a pseudo-3D rendering technique old
video games such as Doom or Wolfenstein 3D .

### Features

 * Basic raycasting (walls, textures, sprites)
 * Animated textures
 * Sprites with Z height (basically it can go up and down)
 * Custom floor and ceilings
 * Lightmap (basically you can set the luminosity of each map tile)
 * Custom bitmap file format (not really a feature, I just didn't bothered to use
